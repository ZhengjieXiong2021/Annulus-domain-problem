# Annulus-domain-problem
1.  Create the annulus domain "circle2" (studpid file name)
2.  Find the eigenvalue roughly on [0,10] by "test1_1" with corresponding plot
3.  Use "annulustest2" to "annulustest2_5" to find better solutions
    "annulustest2" has descriptions for each step
5.  Use "besseltest" to find which solution fits equation (6) (in pdf) best
